haiii I'm Leah but you can also call me Ali or anyone that I kin!
A few things about me: Im a straight ally . I go by she/her . I am native American . I speak English and a little Korean . My bday is June 10th. . I am sorta an extrovert and I will int with you if I want to be friends unless I am with a friend or I want to be left alone.

I am also genuinely a nice person. The only time I am a asshole is if I am, or feel disrespected which is if someone hurts my feelings or my friends feelings. But I am also a dry texter unless we are closeeeee which it is actually really easy to get close with me tbh, not all the time tho.

If you know me irl, u know I talk to myself ALOT. do not troll on me for it 🥀😿✌️
