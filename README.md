I get kinda dry after awhile of knowing someone. It's not anything against you its just thats how I am really tbh idk what to tell you. I don't show my mood based off how I text. If my text are blunt then it dosen't mean im upset or nun. I'm also not someone you'd wanna vent to. I would try to comfort you but its not to much u feel me. Idgaf if your white, black, asian, hispanic ect, straight, gay, lesbian, trans, ect brooooo. I'm not looking for friends to make me look good. I'm looking for friends that'll be with me no matter what.

I really love Asian culture and greek mythology. I've been a fan of asian culture since I was a kid bc of ninjago and tmnt lmaooo
